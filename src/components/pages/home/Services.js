      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>
        Kitsune Analytics is a comprehensive consulting firm with a focus on user research. Using data-driven
        techniques, the scientists at Kitsune Analytics will provide the insights you need about the users of your
        products and services. After the initial consultation, we will provide a customized plan to suit your needs and
        see your project through from start to finish.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are not a simple market research or analytics firm â€” we are the best of both worlds! Because we employ
        a team of research scientists, we are able to make data-driven insights into how your application and/or
        services are perceived, where they excel, where they are lacking, and what strategies could be employed to
        improve performance, likeability, retention, and increase use (as well as a range of other improvement
        measures).
      </p>
      <p>
        We can tackle virtually any question, but our clients typically fall into one of two categories:<br />
        <a href="#services__demographic-analysis"><strong>Demographic Analysis</strong></a> or <a href="#services__performance-analysis"><strong>Performance Analysis</strong></a>.

          <p>
            If you are interested in a demographic analysis of your application and/or service, you are seeking
            answers to questions such as these:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are the spending patterns of the users of my service?</li>
            <li>What kind of people are using my application/service? How old are they?</li>
            <li>Where are they located? How much time are they investing in using my application?</li>
            <li>What groups are investing the most time and money using my application/service? Where are they located?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div className="uberlist">
          <h3 className="title" id="services__performance-analysis">Performance Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            If you are interested in a performance analysis, you are seeking answers to questions such as these:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              What features of my application/service do the users like best and what do they dislike the most?
            </li>
            <li>What kinds of changes would they like to see to my application/service?</li>
            <li>How can I optimize my application/service?</li>
